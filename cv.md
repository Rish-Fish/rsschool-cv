## About me:

I am a beginner Front-End Developer. I started my study path in 2020 in order to check my capabilities, and now I continue with an increasing interest in the profession.

In the past, I worked as a graphic artist and the new sphere has greatly changed my way of information perceptions. It is difficult, but I like how it develops my ability to think.

I love learning a new one and I try to develop my skills in self-study.
